# 📦 Stable-Diffusion-Student-Distillation

Light-weight *Stable Diffusion* students distilled from **SD-1.5** with as little as **65 M** trainable parameters.  
The repository contains three progressively more advanced training pipelines:

| Pipeline | Short name | Key idea(s) | Lines |
|----------|------------|-------------|-------|
| `v1/`    | **V-1**    | progressive DDPM schedule + feature-matching loss | ~600 |
| `v2/`    | **V-2.1**  | noise–matching (*ε*) + OneCycleLR + periodic FID/LPIPS | ~412 |
| `v2/`    | **V-2.2**  | V-2.1 ++ KD term, dynamic α(t) & conditional-dropout | ~310 |

> **TL;DR** &nbsp;V-2.2 (student @ 64×64) reaches **FID ≈ 310** on MS-COCO val (25 DDPM steps, CFG 5) – a **2× improvement** over our baseline &lt; 10 h on a single mobile RTX 3060 6 GB.

## Features

### V-1 (v1/1.py)
- **Progressive DDPM schedule**  
  Gradually shortens the diffusion chain during training.
- **Feature-matching loss**  
  Combines noise-matching (MSE) with intermediate layer-wise distillation via hooks.
- **Adaptive weight projection** (`ConvProjection`)  
  Copies teacher weights into student, slicing/mapping mismatched channels.
- **EMA tracker**  
  Keeps an exponential moving average of student weights for stability.

---

### V-2.1 (v2/2.1.py – “noise-only”)
- **Teacher-to-student slicing**  
  Directly slices teacher UNet tensors to initialize student model.
- **Standard MSE loss on noise**  
  Simplified objective: match student noise prediction to true noise.
- **OneCycleLR scheduler**  
  Cosine-annealed learning‐rate with warm-up.
- **Periodic FID & LPIPS evaluation**  
  On‐the‐fly metrics every N steps (no image dumping).

---

### V-2.2 (v2/2.2.py – “KD + CFG”)
- **Knowledge Distillation term**  
  Adds an MSE loss between student and teacher noise predictions.
- **Dynamic α-schedule**  
  Linearly decays the KD weight α(t) from 1→0.5 through training.
- **Conditional-dropout (CFG mask)**  
  Gradually increases caption dropout rate to regularize guidance.
- **All V-2.1 features inherited**  
  OneCycleLR, teacher slicing, periodic FID/LPIPS.
